🎯 Daily React Challenge #2 - "User Card Component"

Scenario: You're building a user directory for a company app. Create a UserCard component that displays employee information.
Requirements:

    Props interface should include:
        name (string)
        role (string)
        email (string)
        avatarUrl (optional string)
        isOnline (boolean)

    Features:
        Display all user info in a card layout
        Show online/offline status with a colored indicator
        Email should be clickable (opens mail client)
        If no avatar provided, show initials instead
        Card should be hover-interactive (subtle shadow/scale effect)

    Bonus points:
        Make it responsive
        Add a "copy email" button that copies email to clipboard
        Type the onClick handlers properly
